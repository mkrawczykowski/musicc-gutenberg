# My personal project with WP REST API, mega menu & Gutenberg blocks

A website with stock music produced by myself. Main feature will be a section with filters to make finding a song easier.

- coded from Figma
- (almost) pixel perfect
- mega menu
- WP REST API
- SASS + BEM
- Wordpress
- DRY PHP code
- custom Gutenberg blocks built with ACF Pro
- Webpack

## Most interesting features
- src/blocks/filtering-tracks/filtering-tracks.js - a script that displays filtered music tracks using WP REST API
- webpack.config.js - Webpack configuration (probably will be changed) including separation of Gutenberg blocks' styles and scripts
- template-parts/header/header-main-menu.php - mega menu, code split into functions
